        <p>The <b>Rubik's Cube</b> is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974<sup>[2][3]</sup> by Hungarian sculptor
            and
            professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube,<sup>[4]</sup> the puzzle was
            licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp.<br> in 1980 <sup>[5]</sup>, via businessman Tibor Laczi and
            Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer.<br>Rubik's Cube won the 1980 German Game of the Year special award for Best
            Puzzle. As of January 2009, 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide,needs update making it the world's
            bestselling puzzle game and bestselling toy.</p>

            <h2>PRECURSORS</h2>




            In March 1970, Larry D. Nichols invented a 2×2×2 "Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups" and filed a
            Canadian
            patent application for it. Nichols's cube was held together by magnets. Nichols was granted U.S. Patent
            3,655,201[non-primary source needed] on 11 April 1972, two years before Rubik invented his Cube.

            On 9 April 1970, Frank Fox applied to patent an "amusement device", a type of sliding puzzle on a spherical
            surface with "at least two 3×3 arrays" intended to be used for the game of noughts and crosses. He received
            his
            UK patent (1344259) on 16 January 1974

            <h2>Invention</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                In the mid-1970s, Ernő Rubik worked at the Department of Interior Design at the Academy of Applied Arts
                and Crafts in Budapest.[16] Although it is widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching tool to
                help his students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the structural problem of moving
                the parts independently without the entire mechanism falling apart. He did not realise that he had
                created a puzzle until the first time he scrambled his new Cube and then tried to restore it.[17] Rubik
                applied for a patent in Hungary for his "Magic Cube" (Bűvös kocka in Hungarian) on 30 January 1975,[4]
                and HU170062 was granted later that year.

                The first test batches of the Magic Cube were produced in late 1977 and released in Budapest toy shops.
                Magic Cube was held together with interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle being easily
                pulled apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols's design. With Ernő Rubik's permission, businessman Tibor
                Laczi took a Cube to Germany's Nuremberg Toy Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise it.[18]
                It was noticed by Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer, and they signed a deal with Ideal Toys in September
                1979 to release the Magic Cube worldwide.[18] Ideal wanted at least a recognisable name to trademark;
                that arrangement put Rubik in the spotlight because the Magic Cube was renamed after its inventor in
                1980. The puzzle made its international debut at the toy fairs of London, Paris, Nuremberg, and New York
                in January and February 1980.

        <h2>Permutations</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The original (3×3×3) Rubik's Cube has eight corners and twelve edges. There are 8! (40,320) ways to arrange
            the corner cubes. Each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of eight) can be
            oriented independently; the orientation of the eighth (final) corner depends on the preceding seven, giving
            37 (2,187) possibilities. <br>There are 12!/2 (239,500,800) ways to arrange the edges, restricted from 12!
            because edges must be in an even permutation exactly when the corners are. (When arrangements of centres are
            also permitted, as described below, the rule is that the combined arrangement of corners, edges, and centres
            must be an even permutation.)<br> Eleven edges can be flipped independently, with the flip of the twelfth
            depending on the preceding ones, giving 211 (2,048) possibilities.[50]<br>

        <h2>Move Notations:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Many 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube enthusiasts use a notation developed by David Singmaster to denote a sequence of
            moves, referred to as "Singmaster notation".[54] Its relative nature allows algorithms to be written in
            such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours
            are organised on a particular cube.<br>
        <ul>
            <li>F (Front): the side currently facing the solver</li>
            <li>B (Back): the side opposite the front</li>
            <li>U (Up): the side above or on top of the front side</li>
            <li>D (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the Cube</li>
            <li>L (Left): the side directly to the left of the front</li>
            <li>R (Right): the side directly to the right of the front</li>
            <li> (Front two layers): the side facing the solver and the corresponding middle layer</li>
            <li>b (Back two layers): the side opposite the front and the corresponding middle layer</li>
            <li>u (Up two layers): the top side and the corresponding middle layer</li>
            <li>d (Down two layers): the bottom layer and the corresponding middle layer</li>
            <li>l (Left two layers): the side to the left of the front and the corresponding middle layer</li>
            <li>r (Right two layers): the side to the right of the front and the corresponding middle layer</li>
            <l1>y (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on U</l1>
            <li>x (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on R</li>
            <li>z (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on F</li>
        </ul>
